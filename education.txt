Step 1: Install Git
If you haven't installed Git yet, download and install it from the official Git website.

Step 2: Configure Git
Open Git Bash and configure your Git username and email:

bash
Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
Step 3: Generate SSH Key
Generate an SSH key to securely connect to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
Press Enter to accept the default file location, and then set a passphrase if desired.

Step 4: Add SSH Key to GitHub
Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to your GitHub account:

Navigate to Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.
Paste the copied SSH key into the key field and give it a title.
Click Add SSH key.
Step 5: Test SSH Connection
Test the SSH connection to make sure everything is set up correctly:

bash
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a success message if the connection is properly established.

Step 6: Clone a Repository
Clone a repository to your local machine using Git Bash:

bash
Copy code
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
Replace username with your GitHub username and repository with the repository name.

Step 7: Push and Pull Changes
Navigate to your repository directory and use the following commands to interact with your GitHub repository:

To check the status of your repository:

bash
Copy code
git status
To add changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
To commit changes:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message"
To push changes to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
To pull the latest changes from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Replace main with the name of your branch if it's different.

By following these steps, you can access and manage your GitHub account through Git Bash effectively.
